## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing: provides developers with confidence in their code. By writing thorough, meaningful tests, you achieve the confidence that as new features are built or your code is refactored your application will remain functional and stable. Component Testing: another framework-agnostic concept. As a result, component testing frameworks were created to give users the ability to do this in a reliable way while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.  And End-To-End (E2E) Testing: This includes your frontend code, but all associated backend services and infrastructure that are more representative of the environment that your users will be in. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I believe Unit Testing is the most omportant because it provide developers with confidence in their code.  Without confidence or knowledge there is no pont for developeers and the project will suffer.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

E2E testing is my least favorite because tests are limited in their abilities to provide holistic coverage of an application when deployed to production.
