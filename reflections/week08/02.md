## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Because if everybody is on the same page we can work together to build the project.  Without it the project will fall off the rails.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

sprits are obviously going to be shorter but having a daily meeting will make sure everyone is on the same page as far as where to work next. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

That paradox is the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered.  The tradeoffs are Good service Cheap wonâ€™t be Fast, Good service Fast wonâ€™t be Cheap, and Fast service Cheap wonâ€™t be Good.
