## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite tip I have learned so far when imporoving my design is so click on what im trying to change and inspect it.  When I am inspecting it I can manipulate or add with the margins, padding, color, basically anything I want.  If I like my changes I can copy and paste my changes.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

My favorite tip when improving my design is using outsourced bootstrap recourses like bootstrap themes and themestrap.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

A good design shows a more professional appearance.  I personally will judge a company based on its website functionality as well as its appearance.  A company conveys its professionalism as well as its age.  If a website is dated it could lead to being possbily out of touch with the world.
