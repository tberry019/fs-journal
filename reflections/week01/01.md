## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use **Git** because it is a content tracker that in real time could have muplitiple developers working on it.  **Git** makes sure that there are no code conflicts between the code.  **Git** has 3 control systems that allow developers to go back and use older verions of code since projects can often change. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple _branches_ are used to support multiple parallel developments between the master and the test _branch._  This allows devs to work on seperate features on the same project at once and keeps features seperate 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

The difference between them is **Git** holds all your code on your local storage while **GitHub** hosts your code to be viewed on a cloud storage for everyone to view.  **GitHub** is the most popular tool when using **Git**.
