## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use **Git** because it is a content tracker that in real time could have muplitiple developers working on it.  **Git** makes sure that there are no code conflicts between the code.  **Git** has 3 control systems that allow developers to go back and use older verions of code since projects can often change. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple _branches_ are used to support multiple parallel developments between the master and the test _branch._  This allows devs to work on seperate features on the same project at once and keeps features seperate
