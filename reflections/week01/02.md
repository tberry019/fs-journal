## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use'

a **Pseudo-Class** is a keyword added to the selector that provides that word with a special element.  Some common ones I could run into include; user action, time dimensional, resource state, imput, and tree structural.  Those could include key phrases like; hover, past, playing, autofill, and root.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

**Specificity** is built into CSS to determine which rule should run first incase there are multiple rules assigned to it.  You can use **Specificity** to your benefit by applying rules and selectors to give it numerical points of importance.  The higher the number the more important it is. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you use **!important** too many times it will confuse your code and you will not have the correct specificty running in place.  Only use !Important if it is an emergency....or really important.
