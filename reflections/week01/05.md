I was surprised i caught onto so many topics.  most importantly I am not as stressed as i thought i would me but im sure that will change by Monday.

I think i grasped bootstrap pretty well.  I also am getting better knowledge of css and making sure everything looks nice.

- What are you struggling with?

The most stressful thing for me this momenet is getting all my formatting in to being a project like making sure i have bootsrap and debug working properly.  Also making sure my sites run when i want them to work on mobile.

I would count my first project as a victory.  It took me all weekend but i think I got most of what was needed exceot for this sidebar that appeared out of nowhere.
