## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values.  Lower case enums and uppercase enums.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can add a new value to a column of data type enum using ALTER MODIFY command. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not worked specifially with enums in my afternoon projects that I can think of.  I would use them if I needed to give values to something in an interger that is outside of their class or model.
