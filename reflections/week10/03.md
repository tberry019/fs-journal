## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Columns contain the column name, data type, and any other attributes for the column.  Rows contain the records or data for the columns.


2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
  age VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
)default charset utf8 COMMENT '';


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

delete removes all the elents and memory from the table.  Dropping it removes it but can be used again.
