## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type, Reference type, and Pointer type.    Value Type holds a data value within its own memory space.  Reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored.  Pointer Type does not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.


2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float ,int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, and ushort.  I notied it is a lot quicker and faster to get your types in rather than javascript.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

It doesnt hold it in memeory it holds it in another memory location as in another folder.  This differs from value types which store memory in you storage.
