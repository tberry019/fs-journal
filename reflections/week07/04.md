## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We used a little code documentation but mostly in the naming process of what we called things.

2. What went well this week?

Building the server was very difficult at first but then I saw how the process worked and we got it done.

3. What would you do differently?

I wouldve liked to stay more focused as a group and not gotten so disappointed when something went wrong.
