## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary keys are pieces of unique information that are used to identify records on a table.   Foreign keys are used to reference data on another table. 

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is declared following the first instance of the written table name and can be used in place of writting out the full table name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

JOIN doctora id. on account.Id
FROM patiensid && doctorsid
WHERE patiensid=doctorid

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
