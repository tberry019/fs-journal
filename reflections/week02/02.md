## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

The three ways are function declaration, function expression, and arrow function expression.  Function declaration is hoisted while a function expression is not hoisted. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

paramters are used when defining a function and arguments are the values that function receives from that parameter when the function is executed.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

when a function accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function. array.prototype.map is a higher order function.
