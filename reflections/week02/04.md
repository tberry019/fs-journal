## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan before you start writing helps you create a road map of where you would like to start and finish. It gives you a model you can follow so you dont feel lost.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I find answers when I am stuck by googling what I am looking for.  My favorite sites are W3 schools and andything related to bootstrap v5 has helped alot.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

that it is ok to write yourself notes in your code that do not affect anything.  And trying not to reinvent the wheel.  Everything has pretty much been created for me to use.
