> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

you need a way to update parts of the page in response to those events nd the data it provides. Which leads to a lot of push/pull to try and keep all the code in sync with each other.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

the subscribe method, the unsubscrive method, and the broadcast method.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

It uses the data to keep all the code intact so you are not constantly scrambling betwen java scripts to see what you had written.  this bcw template helps us to make it much easier to write our code.
