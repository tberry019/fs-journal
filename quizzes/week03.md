# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
staff.name

```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Removing access to the parts of your code and making it private.  Each object should control its own state.

```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
single responsibility principle.

```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
instance of a class is the copy of the object and the class is the original object.

```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Proxy object enables you to create a proxy for another object, which can intercept and redefine fundamental operations for that object.  It consists of the target and the handler.

```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It is al about separation of concerns.  Each component is responsible for one job.  

```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The controller is the function of the code.  It handles all DOM interaction such as click events and draws.

```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

The service is the only place to manipulate data.  It handles all data changes and business logic.

```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

The model holds all of your core information that you are using to access and manipulate in your application.
